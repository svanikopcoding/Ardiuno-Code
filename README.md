# Drag Race Arduino

## Components Needed:
-  Arduino Uno (or any compatible board)
- Two DC motors
- Motor driver (like L298N)
- Start button
- Power source (battery pack)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Wiring:
- Connect the motors to the motor driver outputs.
- Connect the motor driver inputs to Arduino digital pins.
- Connect the start button to an Arduino digital pin.
- Connect the motor driver power inputs to the power source.

## Explanation:
- Pin Definitions: Define the pins for the motors and the start button.
- Setup: Initialize the motor pins as outputs and the button pin as input. Set the initial state of the motors to off.
- Loop: Continuously check the state of the start button. When the button is pressed, the motors are activated to move the robot forward. When the button is not pressed, the motors stop.

## Additional Considerations:
- Speed Control: You can use PWM to control motor speed by adjusting the values in analogWrite for the enable pins.
- Direction Control: For reversing direction, you can toggle the HIGH/LOW states of the motor pins.
- Safety: Ensure that the motors are connected properly to avoid any short circuits or damage.
